# UFO Sightings Analysis 👽
Dataset: Kaggle UFO Sightings Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings
Tools Used: Python (pandas, matplotlib), Tableau, Jupyter Notebook

## Overview 📊 
This project explores UFO sightings using a dataset containing over 80,000 UFO sightings in the last century.
My analysis is performed using Python (pandas, Matplotlib) and visualized in Tableau for interactive exploration.

## Key topics explored 🗝️
✔️ When do UFO sightings occur most? (Seasonal trends)
<br>
✔️ Are UFO sightings increasing over time?
<br>
✔️ Where are UFO sightings most common?

## Key Findings 📈
1️⃣ Monthly UFO Sightings – Most Common in July ☀️
🔹 Sightings peak in July, this might be due to:

Clearer skies → More visibility for strange objects
More outdoor activities → More people are out and about in the summer months
<br>
🔹 Sightings are lowest in winter months, presumably due to:
<br>
Colder weather → Fewer people outside at night
Cloud cover → Reduced visibility
Graph: (See Tableau for interactive visualization) 📊

2️⃣ Yearly UFO Sightings – Steady Increase 📈
<br>
🔹 UFO sightings have risen significantly since the 1990s.
<br>
🔹 Possible reasons:

Social media & technology → Easier to share and report sightings
Smartphones → More cameras available to capture strange events
Increased interest in UFOs → Pop culture & government reports

3️⃣ Geographic Trends – Most Common in North America 🌎
🔹 The United States has the highest number of reports.
🔹 Possible reasons:

More open land → Easier to spot flying objects in rural areas
Higher awareness → Media and government reports fuel interest
Military testing areas → Some sightings may be experimental aircraft
